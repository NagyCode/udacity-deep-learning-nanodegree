# Deep Learning Nanodegree

Code and Projects of Deep Learning Nanodegree.

Project 1:
Bike sharing. In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

Project 2:
In this project, you'll classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset will need to be preprocessed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. You'll normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. At then end, you'll see their predictions on the sample images.
